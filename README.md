WPS Office full language support
==========

This repository includes the files from WPS Office for Windows used for dictionaries and the language GUI.
You can place them in their folder, inside "office6/" in order to add a language. The locations depends of your Linux distribution, but if you use Arch Linux, you can use the AUR I will make.
